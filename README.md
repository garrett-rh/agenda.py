# Agenda

This is a command line agenda that I use daily on my computer. It runs using python 3.x. I have NOT tested this on Windows.
I have no plans on making a GUI for it because I spend most of my time in the CLI. Although it is fully functional, I still plan on adding features as I come across them.

To get this to run on your machine, you will have to edit the fifth line to match where you would like to store the database. Other than that, it should work out of the box.
